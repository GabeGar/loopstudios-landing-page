## My process

### Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
-   [TailWind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

-   Applied myself to work with tailwind css once again and it turned out better than before.

-   Learned to create a modal via react portals, to keep the topography of my app, as organized as possible.

-   Utilizing built-in css methods for rendering content conditionally, without tapping into javascript (aside from rendering the modal via createPortal(), using react). This enabled me to create the ui navigation (hamburger on mobile and links visible ina row on desktop), without having to conditionally render two separate nav components, entirely.

### Continued development

-   Need to work to improve my css positioning skills with relative, absolute, sticky, fixed and the like.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/css-trick-animating-link-underlines/) - Helped me apply css styling for underlining anchor tags on my page, for the active states portion.
